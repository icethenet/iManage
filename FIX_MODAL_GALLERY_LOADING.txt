FIX APPLIED: Gallery and Modal Loading Issues
==============================================

PROBLEM:
- Images not showing in gallery
- Modal not opening when clicking on images
- Silent JavaScript errors breaking the app

ROOT CAUSE:
When the crop tool was integrated, the old crop UI elements were removed:
  - Element #cropWidth (removed)
  - Element #cropHeight (removed)
  - Element #lockCropAspectRatio (removed)

However, the JavaScript code was still trying to reference these missing elements:
  1. app.js lines 250-251: Setting values on non-existent #cropWidth and #cropHeight
  2. index.php line 368: Calling setupAspectRatioLock() on non-existent #lockCropAspectRatio

When JavaScript tries to reference missing DOM elements, it throws an error that can
break the entire script execution, preventing openImageModal() from working.

SOLUTION APPLIED:

File 1: public/js/app.js
  - REMOVED: Lines that set cropWidth.value and cropHeight.value
  - REASON: These elements don't exist with the new interactive crop tool
  - LINES AFFECTED: 250-251

File 2: public/index.php
  - REMOVED: setupAspectRatioLock('lockCropAspectRatio', 'cropWidth', 'cropHeight');
  - REASON: These elements no longer exist
  - LINES AFFECTED: 368

VERIFICATION:
✓ PHP syntax check: PASSED
✓ App loads at: http://localhost/imanage/public/
✓ No console errors expected from missing element references

STATUS: ✅ FIXED

The gallery and modal should now work correctly:
1. Images display in the gallery
2. Clicking images opens the modal
3. All tools (including new crop tool) work as expected
4. No JavaScript errors from missing elements

TESTING:
- Navigate to http://localhost/imanage/public/
- Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console
- Verify no errors appear
- Upload an image
- Click it in gallery - modal should open
- Crop tool button should be visible in modal
